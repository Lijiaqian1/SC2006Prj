# SC2006-Project - CCRental Project 

## Project Description and Idea
In Singapore, car ownership and maintenance is a hustle and compared to the world, expensive too. As a result, car renting has become an economical way for Singaporeans to get the experience of owning a car for a period of time without all the hassles and financial burden that comes with car ownership. Also, car renting services have since become increasingly popular among Singaporeans families and young adults. Furthermore, with Singaporeâ€™s highly connected transport network, some Singaporeans may only require the use of a car for a certain period of time, hence allowing them to resort to rental cars instead of owning a private vehicle. 

There are several growing platforms and companies where users are able to rent cars such as Getgo, CarLite and TribeCar. Each company has its own way of charging users with various different prices at different timings. As a customer, we are always on the lookout for the cheapest and best price in the market and the same goes for renting cars. Also, with the increasing cost of living in Singapore, Singaporeans are always sourcing for the cheapest service. However, comparing prices in rental cars is not always as easy as it seems, it requires the comparison of different applications and calculation of different prices. 

As such, our team intends on bridging this gap by helping users calculate the cheapest real time prices from different car rental platforms to compare and choose what is best for the user.
